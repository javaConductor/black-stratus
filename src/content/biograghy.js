				<h2>Biography</h2>
				Nero was Roman emperor from 54 to 68 CE. The last of the Julio-Claudians to rule the Roman Empire,
				his 14-year reign represents everything decadent about that period in Roman history.
				He was self-indulgent, cruel, and violent as well as a cross-dressing exhibitionist.
				His lavish parties combined with the burning of Rome continued the economic chaos that
				had plagued the Roman citizenry since the days of Tiberius (r. 14-37 CE). According to the
				historian Suetonius in his The Twelve Caesars, upon hearing of the emperor's death by
				suicide, "â€¦citizens ran through the streets wearing caps of liberty as though they were freed
				slaves."
